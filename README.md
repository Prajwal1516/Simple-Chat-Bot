# Simple-Chat-Bot
Building a Simple Chatbot with Python and NLTK
Project Overview:
The chatbot was built by defining pairs and reflections, which are used to match the user's input to predefined responses. Here’s a brief breakdown of the process:
•	Pairs: These are pattern-response pairs. For instance, if the user says "hello", the bot responds with a friendly greeting like "Hi there!".
•	Reflections: These help the chatbot dynamically adjust responses by mapping certain words like "I" to "you", ensuring a more natural conversation flow.
•	Interactive Frontend: I also developed a simple yet engaging frontend to make the bot easily accessible to users. This interface allows users to interact with the chatbot smoothly and efficiently.
